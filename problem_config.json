    "description": "In the bin packing with conflicts problem, a number of items with known weights must be assigned to bins with uniform capacity. Furthermore, each item is in conflict with a list of forbidden items. Conflicting items cannot be placed in the same bin. The objective is to minimize the number of bins used.",
